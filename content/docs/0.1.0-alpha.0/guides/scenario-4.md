# Scenario-4

**This docs trying to explain the behavior of Pack**
***

This section explain [test-4](https://github.com/kubepack/kubepack/tree/master/docs/_testdata/test-4).

If you look into this test's `manifest.yaml` file.

```console
$ cat manifest.yaml

package: github.com/kubepack/kubepack/docs/_testdata/test-4
owners:
- name: Appscode
  email: team@appscode.com
dependencies:
- package: github.com/kubepack/kube-a
  branch: test-4
- package: github.com/kubepack/kube-b
  branch: test-4
```

Here, [test-4](https://github.com/kubepack/kubepack/tree/master/docs/_testdata/test-4) depends on two repositories.
1. [kube-a](https://github.com/kubepack/kube-a) of branch `test-4`.
2. [kube-b](https://github.com/kubepack/kube-b) of branch `test-4`.

Both of the above repository(kube-a and kube-b) require dependency of
 [kube-c](https://github.com/kubepack/kube-c) but two different branch.
 `kube-a` depends on `kube-c` of branch `test-1` and `kube-b` depends on `kube-c` of branch `master`.

 To clarify, see image.

 Now, when run `$ pack dep --v=10` command, `pack` could not resolve dependencies. As, this dependencies contradict with each other.
  Give below error.

  ```console
  $ pack dep --v=10
