# Scenario-1

**This docs trying to explain the behavior of Pack**
***

This section explain [test-1](https://github.com/kubepack/pack/tree/master/docs/_testdata/test-1).

If you look into this test's `dependency-list.yaml` file.

```console
$ cat dependency-list.yaml

items:
- package: github.com/kubepack/kube-a
  branch: test-1

```

See image below, which describe whole dependency.

![alt text](/docs/0.1.0/_testdata/test-1/test-1.jpg)

Explanation of image:

1. This test directly depends on branch `test-1` of `kube-a` repository.

2. `kube-a`'s depends on branch `test-1` of `kube-b`.
See this dependency-list.yaml file [here](https://github.com/kubepack/kube-a/blob/test-1/dependency-list.yaml)

3. `kube-b`'s depends on branch `test-1` of `kube-c`.
See this dependency-list.yaml file [here](https://github.com/kubepack/kube-b/blob/test-1/dependency-list.yaml)

4. `kube-c` has no dependency.
See this dependency-list.yaml file [here](https://github.com/kubepack/kube-c/blob/test-1/dependency-list.yaml)


Now, `$ pack dep -f .` command will get all the dependencies and place it under `manifests/vendor` folder.

`$ pack up -f .` will generate final version with annotated with `git-commit-hash`.
